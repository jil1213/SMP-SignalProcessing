# SMP-SignalProcessing

In this Repositiory are all scripts for my master thesis stored.

Folder data stores the measured data and converted files

## visualizationsdensity

can be used to import and visualize denity measuremnts stored in csv files

## readSMP

can be used to read .pnt SMP files. They can be converted into a csv file without any reduction of datapoints
SMP files can also be stored in dataframes and in further steps for eample used for visualization (and later for signal processing)
